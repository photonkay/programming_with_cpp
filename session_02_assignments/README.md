# Programming/Coding Tasks on Control Structures

This folder contains coding tasks and practices for **Session 02: Control Structures**. These tasks will help you master the use of loops, conditionals, and switch cases in C++.

1. **if_else_conditions.cpp**  
   Create a C++ script that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**. Print the result using if-else conditions.
   
2. **grading_system.cpp**  
   Write a C++ script that takes a student's grade (as a percentage) as input and outputs their corresponding letter grade based on the following scheme:
   - A: 80 - 100%
   - B: 70 - 79%
   - C: 60 - 69%
   - D: 50 - 59%
   - F: 0 - 49%
   
3. **odd_even.cpp**  
   Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input from the user and determines whether it is **odd** or **even** using an if-else structure.

4. **smallest_number.cpp**  
   Create a C++ script where the user inputs **three numbers**, and the program prints the **smallest number** using if-else statements.

5. **switch_calculator.cpp**  
   Create a simple calculator using a **switch-case** statement. The program should allow the user to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two input numbers and then output the result.

6. **factorial.cpp**  
   Write a C++ program that calculates the **factorial** of a given number using a **for loop**.

7. **sum_of_numbers.cpp**  
   Create a C++ script that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the **sum of all numbers from 1 to that number** using a **while loop**.

9. **multiplication_table.cpp**  
   Write a C++ program that outputs the **multiplication table** for any number entered by the user using a **for loop**.

10. **fibonacci_series.cpp**  
    Create a C++ script that prints the **Fibonacci series** up to a specified number of terms, which the user provides. Use a **while loop**.

11. **nested_loops_pattern.cpp**  
    Write a C++ program that prints the following pattern using **nested loops**:
    ```
